Since we interact the UNIX shell via typing commands, there a few key shortcuts we can use to save the amount of typing we must do (and therefore minimise errors associated with human input of commands). 
In particular, the use of "~" ".." are useful when changing directories or accessing files. 
Additionally, the use of 'tab completion' can help us ensure we are typing commands, directory paths and file paths appropriately. 

> ## Common Shortcuts  
> **Home Directory** -- the tilda symbol "~" represents your home directory, e.g. /homeN/XX/jcXXYYY  
> **Current Directory** -- a single full-stop "." represents your current working directory, e.g. same directory returned by `pwd`  
> **Parent Directory** -- a double full-stop ".." represents the *parent* of your current working directory  
> **Root Directory** -- on it's own, a single forwardslash "/" represents the root directory, e.g. the bottom of the directory *tree*  
> **New Directory** -- between two words, a forwardslash "/" represents a new directory, e.g. in this situation "/homeN/XX/" the directory "XX" is contained within the directory "homeN"  
> **Up & Down Arrows** -- use these keys to navigate through your command history  
> **Tab Key** -- performs *autocompletion* of commands, directory paths & file paths  
> **Escape Character** -- a single backslash "\\" is used to 'escape' special characters, such as spaces, ampersands & apostrophes  
> **Environment Variables** -- when you open your shell, a number of pre-saved variables, so called 'environment' variables are set for you. You can view them all by executing the command `printenv`, and access individual variables by prefacing their name with a "$", e.g. $USER or $HOSTNAME.  
> **Wildcards** -- the asterisk symbol "*" can be used to represent a string of characters of non-zero length; most commonly you can integrate an '\*' into other commands to create search patterns.  For example, `ls *zip` will display all files and directories that end with "zip", regardless of the leading characters.

## Basic UNIX Syntax

cd - change directory
mkdir - create a new directory

Here use 'cd' and 'mkdir' as explainers to demonstrate the use of up/down, tab and escape

~~~
$ mkdir hpc_carpentry

$ cd hpc_carpentry

$ mkdir test_jobs

$ cd test_jobs

$ mkdir data

$ pwd

$ cd ..

$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}

For the next set of commands, start typing the directory name, then use the Tab key to autofill

~~~
$ cd hpc_carpentry

$ cd test_jobs

$ cd data

$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}


Type the command `whoami`,
then press the ENTER key to send the command to the shell.
The command's output is the ID of the current user,
i.e.,
it shows us who the shell thinks we are:

~~~
$ whoami
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
kcahill
~~~
{: .output}

More specifically, when we type `whoami` the shell:

1.  finds a program called `whoami`,
2.  runs that program,
3.  displays that program's output, then
4.  displays a new prompt to tell us that it's ready for more commands.


> ## Unknown commands
> bash: cd: TEST: No such file or directory  
> bash: mycommand: command not found  
> bash: pwd: -Y: invalid option  
{: .callout}

Next,
let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd`
(which stands for "print working directory").
At any moment,
our **current working directory**
is our current default directory,
i.e.,
the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in
unless we explicitly specify something else.
Here,
the computer's response is `/Users/nelle`,
which is Nelle's **home directory**:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle
~~~
{: .output}

## Telling the Difference between the Local Terminal and the Remote Terminal

`echo $HOME`  
`echo $HOSTNAME`
## Navigating the Remote System

Using `ls`
and using `cd`

# Using help/man to find all available options.

`ls` has lots of other options. To find out what they are, we can type:

~~~
[remote]$ ls --help
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .
  -A, --almost-all           do not list implied . and ..
      --author               with -l, print the author of each file
  -b, --escape               print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters
      --block-size=SIZE      scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g.,
                               '--block-size=M' prints sizes in units of
                               1,048,576 bytes; see SIZE format below
  -B, --ignore-backups       do not list implied entries ending with ~
  -c                         with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last
                               modification of file status information);
                               with -l: show ctime and sort by name;
                               otherwise: sort by ctime, newest first
  -C                         list entries by columns
      --color[=WHEN]         colorize the output; WHEN can be 'always' (default
                               if omitted), 'auto', or 'never'; more info below
  -d, --directory            list directories themselves, not their contents
  -D, --dired                generate output designed for Emacs' dired mode
  -f                         do not sort, enable -aU, disable -ls --color
  -F, --classify             append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries
      --file-type            likewise, except do not append '*'
      --format=WORD          across -x, commas -m, horizontal -x, long -l,
                               single-column -1, verbose -l, vertical -C
      --full-time            like -l --time-style=full-iso
  -g                         like -l, but do not list owner
      --group-directories-first
                             group directories before files;
                               can be augmented with a --sort option, but any
                               use of --sort=none (-U) disables grouping
  -G, --no-group             in a long listing, don't print group names
  -h, --human-readable       with -l and/or -s, print human readable sizes
                               (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)
      --si                   likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024
  -H, --dereference-command-line
                             follow symbolic links listed on the command line
      --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir
                             follow each command line symbolic link
                               that points to a directory
      --hide=PATTERN         do not list implied entries matching shell PATTERN
                               (overridden by -a or -A)
      --indicator-style=WORD  append indicator with style WORD to entry names:
                               none (default), slash (-p),
                               file-type (--file-type), classify (-F)
  -i, --inode                print the index number of each file
  -I, --ignore=PATTERN       do not list implied entries matching shell PATTERN
  -k, --kibibytes            default to 1024-byte blocks for disk usage
  -l                         use a long listing format

....

The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).
Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).

Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and
with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when
standard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment
variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.

Exit status:
 0  if OK,
 1  if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),
 2  if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

Many bash commands, and programs that people have written that can be
run from within bash, support a `--help` flag to display more
information on how to use the commands or programs.

These then, are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your computer:
`pwd`, `ls` and `cd`.  Let's explore some variations on those commands.  What happens
if you type `cd` on its own, without giving
a directory?  

~~~
[remote]$ cd
~~~
{: .bash}

How can you check what happened?  `pwd` gives us the answer!  

~~~
[remote]$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle
~~~
{: .output}

It turns out that `cd` without an argument will return you to your home directory,
which is great if you've gotten lost in your own filesystem.  

Let's try returning to the `data` directory from before.  Last time, we used
three commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories
to move to `data` in one step:

~~~
[remote]$ cd hpc_carpentry/test_jobs/data
~~~
{: .bash}

Check that we've moved to the right place by running `pwd` and `ls`  

If we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use `cd ..`.  But
there is another way to move to any directory, regardless of your
current location.  

So far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as above),
we have been using **relative paths**.  When you use a relative path with a command
like `ls` or `cd`, it tries to find that location  from where we are,
rather than from the root of the file system.  

However, it is possible to specify the **absolute path** to a directory by
including its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated by a
leading slash.  The leading `/` tells the computer to follow the path from
the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory,
no matter where we are when we run the command.

This allows us to move to our `test_jobs` directory from anywhere on
the filesystem (including from inside `data`).  To find the absolute path
we're looking for, we can use `pwd` and then extract the piece we need
to move to `test_jobs`.  

Run `pwd` and `ls` to ensure that we're in the directory we expect.  

### Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files

Knowing just this much about files and directories,
Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.
First,
she creates a directory called `north-pacific-gyre`
(to remind herself where the data came from).
Inside that,
she creates a directory called `2012-07-03`,
which is the date she started processing the samples.
She used to use names like `conference-paper` and `revised-results`,
but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years.
(The final straw was when she found herself creating
a directory called `revised-revised-results-3`.)

### touch, cp, mv, rm, rmdir, scp

**touch** — The touch command is used to create a file. It can be anything, from an empty txt file to an empty zip file. For example, “touch new.txt”

**cp** — Use the cp command to copy files through the command line. It takes two arguments: The first is the location of the file to be copied, the second is where to copy.

**mv** — Use the mv command to move files through the command line. We can also use the mv command to rename a file. For example, if we want to rename the file “text” to “new”, we can use “mv text new”. It takes the two arguments, just like the cp command.
