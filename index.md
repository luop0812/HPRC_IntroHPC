Advanced computing skills and the capacity to analyse large datasets are key for many researchers across a variety of disciplines.  
This workshop is designed to enable researchers to use High Performance Computing **(HPC)** systems to improve their research efficiency. 

By the end of this workshop, students will know how to:

* Use the UNIX command line and the OnDemand web portal to connect to a remote computer.
* Navigate and interact with files using the UNIX command line.
* Work interactively with programs on an HPC setup.
